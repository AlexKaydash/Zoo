          <p>It is easy to recognize a skunk by its "brand" coloration, consisting of white spots, stripes and/or spots on a black background. Skunks have a rather strong build, a fluffy tail and short legs with sharp claws, perfectly adapted for digging.</p>

          <p>The sight of skunks is weak, but this deficiency is more than compensated by an excellent sense of smell and hearing.</p>

          <p>The largest of the skunk family - pig-faced skunks weigh up to 4.5 kg, the smallest - spotted skunks do not weigh more than 1 kg.</p>

          <p>In general, the appearance of a skunk is very attractive, some people even domesticate skunks, having previously solved the problem with their smell, we will write about this in more detail below.</p>

          <p>Where does a skunk live? The skunk lives almost all over the territory of North America, from Canada to Mexico, it is found in South America and on the islands of Indonesia. These stinking animals are nowhere else.

           As places of residence, they choose a forest area where they feel most comfortable.</p></code></td>
