      <td colspan="3"><p align="justify"><code><p>Water pig is the official scientific name of capybari. The aborigines of South and Central America call the porcupine differently - caprincho, poncho, corpincho, capigua and chiguire. It is believed that the rodent received the most accurate name from the Tupa tribes of Brazil, who nicknamed it "the eater of thin grass" (capybara).</p>

        <p>The writer Gerald Darrell compared the rodent (has a calm and protective expression of the face) to a pensive lion, not forgetting to add that the capybara, unlike the king of beasts, is a good-natured vegetarian.</p>

        <p>It remains to be wondered how this algae eater can gain a record (against other rodents) weight: males weigh 54-63 kg, females - from 62 to 74 kg. But this is not the limit - it is known that one female weighs almost 81 kg, and the second - 91 kg.</p>

        <p>The height at the withers reaches 50-62 cm. The capybara has a wide head with an almost square face, equipped with neat ears, small widely spaced nostrils and small eyes.</p>

        <p>The animal has 20 teeth, the "scariest" of which are huge bright orange incisors that resemble sharp folding knives. Cheek teeth, devoid of roots, grow throughout life.</p>

        <p>The coat of a guinea pig is coarse and hard, grows to 3-12 cm, but does not have an undercoat. Thanks to this, the rodent's skin quickly burns under the sun, which is why the capybara often lies in the mud.</p></code></td>
